404: Page Not Found
-------------------

Oh dear.  You seem to have been directed to a page that doesn't actually
exist.  Assuming you are indeed interested in `static_gettext`, I hope you
can find what you're looking for on one of these fine pages:

<ul class="usage" role="navigation">
  <li><a href="./install.html">Installation</a></li>
  <li><a href="./markup.html">Marking translatable strings</a></li>
  <li><a href="./extraction.html">Message file generation</a></li>
  <li><a href="./build.html">Generating target-language localizations</a></li>
</ul>
